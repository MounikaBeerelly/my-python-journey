## Understanding NumPy Arrays

1. NumPy arrays are the core data structure of the NumPy library
2. Understanding NumPy is fundemental to working efficiently with numerical data in Python
3. NumPy arrays provide High-performance,Multi-dimensional data structures optimized for numerical computations.

## What is a NumPy Array?

1. A NumPy array is often referred to as ndarray: N-dimesional array, which is a grid of values.
2. All the values in an array should be of the same type
3. Elements in NumPy array are indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers
4. The number of dimensions and the shape of the array are defined by the user, making it highly flexible.

## How amny dimensions are supported by NumPy Arrays?

1. NumPy arrays are multi-dimensional
2. A NumPy array can be
    1. Single dimension : 1D called as vector
    2. Two dimensions : 2D called as matrix
    3. Three OR more dimensions : Higher-dimensional called as Tensor

## Note:

1. fixed size
    - Once a NumPy array is created, its size cannot be changed. Which means elements cannot be added OR Removed, but the values in the array can be modified.

2. Homogeneous
    - All elements in a NumPy array must have the same data type, making it more memory-efficient than Python lists.
