2. The Module file can contain a set of
    1. Reusable Variables
    2. Reusable Constants
    3. Reusable Exceptions
    4. Reusable Functions

#### What are the steps followed in designing a Module ?
**Step 1 : Creating the Module file** -
    1. Open any Text editor
    2. Write the required Python code that has to be shared as a module, generally a set of `Python functions`.
    3. Save the module file with `.py` extension in a particular directory as specified by the Administrator (save in the same location where the operational program is saved).
**Step 2 : Using the Module** -
    1. Open any text editor
    2. Design the required Python program
    3. Use the `import` statement declared with the module name (This is the Module fiel name without keeping .py extension).
    4. Use the required functions in the operational code from the imported module by calling the corresponding function name.
