### What are Anonymous Functions :
1. Anonymous functions in general are also called as `Lambda functions`.
2. Anonymous OR Lambda functions are useful for
    - Short and simple operations in business logic
    - We should plan anonymous OR lambda functions when we need a small function operating for a short period

    lambda functionArguments: lambdaExpression
```

- Calling a function without the braces - it will return the function address.
